# Neon Claude Code Plugin Distribution Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the distribution strategy for the Neon Claude Code plugin, covering repository setup, marketplace configuration, and launch preparation for public distribution via GitHub.

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists Now
- **Repository Structure**: Single unified plugin (`neon-marketplace/neon-plugin/`) with 4 skills
- **Skills**: neon-drizzle (comprehensive), neon-serverless, neon-toolkit, add-neon-docs
- **MCP Integration**: Remote MCP server configured at `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp`
- **Context Rules**: 13 `.mdc` files for various Neon integrations
- **Status**: Development marketplace (`dev-marketplace/`) ready for production

### Key Discoveries
- Current structure follows Claude Code best practices (neon-marketplace/neon-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json:1-8)
- MCP server integration is properly configured (neon-marketplace/neon-plugin/.mcp.json:1-12)
- Skills are well-organized with templates, scripts, and guides
- Marketplace metadata exists but needs production updates (neon-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json:1-13)

## Desired End State

After completing this plan:
1. **Public GitHub repository** at `github.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-rules`
2. **Production marketplace** with proper metadata and versioning
3. **Users can install** via `/plugin marketplace add neondatabase-labs/ai-rules/neon-marketplace`
4. **Documentation** includes clear installation and usage instructions
5. **Initial release** tagged as `v1.0.0`

### Verification
- [ ] Fresh Claude Code installation can discover and install the plugin
- [ ] All 4 skills load and execute correctly
- [ ] MCP server connects successfully
- [ ] README installation instructions work end-to-end
- [ ] GitHub repository is discoverable via search

## What We're NOT Doing

- **Not splitting into multiple plugins** - Single unified plugin is optimal for current scope
- **Not creating separate marketplaces** - One marketplace for all Neon tools
- **Not hosting on custom servers** - Using GitHub for simplicity and discoverability
- **Not requiring authentication** - Public open-source distribution
- **Not adding new skills yet** - Shipping current 4 skills first

## Implementation Approach

We'll follow a phased approach:
1. Update metadata and configuration files
2. Enhance documentation with installation instructions
3. Set up GitHub repository
4. Test the complete installation flow
5. Launch and announce

Each phase has clear automated and manual verification steps.

## Phase 1: Update Plugin Metadata

### Overview
Update all configuration files with production values (repository URLs, proper owner info, versioning, licensing).

### Changes Required

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Plugin Configuration
**File**: `neon-marketplace/neon-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
**Changes**: Add complete metadata

```json

## Maintenance & Updates

### Versioning Strategy

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **Major (2.0.0)**: Breaking changes to skill interfaces or MCP integration
- **Minor (1.1.0)**: New skills, new context rules, new features
- **Patch (1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, template improvements

### Release Process

For each new version:
1. Update version in `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes
3. Create git tag: `git tag v1.x.x`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.x.x`
5. Create GitHub release
6. Announce on social media

Users will automatically get updates when they reload Claude Code or run `/plugin update`.

### Monitoring

Track these metrics:
- **GitHub stars**: Indicates interest and satisfaction
- **Issues/PRs**: Community engagement
- **Clones/downloads**: Installation rate
- **MCP server usage**: Active users (if metrics available)
- **Social mentions**: Reach and sentiment

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions

1. **MCP Server Downtime**
   - Risk: Users can't access MCP features
   - Mitigation: Skills work independently; document server status page
   - Fallback: Skills provide value even without MCP

2. **Breaking Changes in Claude Code**
   - Risk: Plugin stops working after Claude Code update
   - Mitigation: Monitor Claude Code changelog; test pre-releases
   - Response: Quick patch release with fixes

3. **GitHub Rate Limiting**
   - Risk: Users can't install due to rate limits
   - Mitigation: Use GitHub releases for distribution
   - Alternative: Host marketplace JSON on CDN if needed

4. **Skill Conflicts**
   - Risk: Skills conflict with user's existing plugins
   - Mitigation: Use unique skill names; namespace resources
   - Testing: Test with popular plugin combinations

5. **Documentation Drift**
   - Risk: Docs become outdated as features change
   - Mitigation: Update docs in same PR as code changes
   - Process: Require doc updates for all feature PRs

## Questions & Clarifications

**Q: Why does release timeline affect version numbering?**

A: It affects how we handle pre-release versions:
- **Publishing today (v1.0.0)**: Indicates production-ready, stable, fully tested
- **Publishing next week (v1.0.0-beta)**: Indicates testing period, expect changes
- **Publishing in a month (v0.9.0)**: Indicates still adding features before 1.0

Since you're publishing today and the plugin is feature-complete with 4 working skills, MCP integration, and comprehensive documentation, `v1.0.0` is the appropriate choice. This signals to users that it's production-ready and stable.

If you were still adding major features or wanted a beta testing period, we'd use `v1.0.0-beta.1` or `v0.9.0` to signal "not quite ready yet."
