# Add Neon Knowledge References to Project

This skill adds reference links to Neon documentation and best practices in your project's AI documentation file, enabling AI assistants to quickly access Neon-specific patterns and guidelines without cluttering your project with large documentation files.

## How It Works

This skill follows a simple workflow:

1. **Load metadata** - Read skill information from `skill-knowledge-map.json`
2. **Detect documentation file** - Find `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or Cursor rules files
3. **Ask permission** - Show what will be added and where
4. **Add references** - Insert URLs in a "Resources & References" section
5. **Report completion** - Confirm successful installation

For detailed workflow steps, see `install-knowledge.md`.

## Parameters

### SKILL_NAME (Optional)

Specifies which Neon skill documentation to install:
- `"neon-drizzle"` - Drizzle ORM integration guide
- `"neon-serverless"` - Serverless connection patterns
- `"neon-toolkit"` - Ephemeral database management
- `"neon-auth"` - Authentication patterns

If not provided, you'll be prompted to choose which skill documentation to install.

Available skills and their reference URLs are defined in `skill-knowledge-map.json`.

## Usage Examples

**Called from another skill:**
```markdown
Execute the add-neon-knowledge skill with SKILL_NAME="neon-drizzle"
```

**Called directly by user:**
- "Add neon drizzle knowledge to my project"
- "Install neon serverless documentation"
- "Set up Neon best practices for my AI assistant"

## What Gets Added

References are added to a "Resources & References" section in your AI documentation file:

```markdown
## Resources & References

- **Neon and Drizzle ORM best practices**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-rules/main/neon-drizzle.mdc
- **Serverless connection patterns**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-rules/main/neon-serverless.mdc
```

### Target Files (in priority order):
- `CLAUDE.md` - Most common for Claude Code projects
- `AGENTS.md` - Custom AI documentation files
- `.cursor/README.md` or `.cursor/rules.md` - Cursor IDE projects
- Creates `CLAUDE.md` if none exist

### Behavior:
- Existing "Resources & References" sections: New links are appended
- No existing section: Section is created at end of file
- No documentation file: `CLAUDE.md` is created with references
